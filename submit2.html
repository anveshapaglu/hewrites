It was around 10:30 or maybe 11 at night when my friend called me.<br>

I had just bought a new iPhone 15 from the Flipkart sale, and he was excited.<br>
“Come to my society,” he said. “We’ll click some photos and videos for Instagram.<br>”

I agreed.<br>

I started my bike and rode to his society.<br>
After some time, he suggested we go to a part of the society that was… abandoned.<br>

The place had been left incomplete.<br>
There were rumors—something about a construction worker dying there.<br>
I didn’t know the full story, and honestly, I didn’t care much.<br>

   
     
           
I had been there before.<br>
Just not this late.<br>

Still, I said yes.<br>

The area was dark.<br>
Unnaturally quiet.<br>

We started clicking photos—just normal pictures of Ayaan.<br>
After 7 or 8 photos, something strange happened.<br>

While focusing on him, I noticed the camera focus shifting behind him.<br>

There was nothing there.<br>
Just darkness.<br>

A strange fear crawled into my chest.<br>

I told him.<br>
He laughed. Made fun of me.<br>
“Glitch hoga,” he said.<br>


       

        
     I tried to convince myself the same.<br>

Then he said, “Let’s shoot in cinematic mode.”<br>

I switched it on.<br>

As I started recording, the focus—<br>
the same focus—<br>
moved from behind him… and started coming forward.<br>

Towards me.<br>

My hands went cold.<br>

Suddenly, my camera flickered.<br>
The screen blinked.<br>
And then—<br>

Error: Camera not responding. Try again.<br>

My phone switched off completely.<br>

I was terrified.<br>

It was around 11:30 PM now.<br>

Ayaan told me to stay the night at his place, but I knew my mother wouldn’t allow it.<br>
So I decided to leave.
<br>
Before going, he insisted we take 4–5 rounds inside the society.<br>
I agreed, though my heart was pounding.<br>

After that, I started my bike and rode towards home.<br>

The moment I crossed the society gate—<br>

my bike stopped.<br>

No self-start.<br>
Nothing.<br>

At the same moment, the society lights went off.<br>

Complete darkness.<br>

My bike felt heavy, as if someone was sitting behind me.<br>

My breathing became uneven.<br>

After 7–8 kicks, the bike finally started.<br>

I didn’t look back.<br>

I just rode.<br>

When I reached home and started climbing the stairs,<br>
I suddenly felt a huge weight on my back.<br>

Like someone was holding me.<br>
Or riding me.<br>

I froze.<br>

I rushed inside, locked the door, plugged my phone into charging, and called my best friend—a girl.<br>
I begged her to stay on video call while I slept.<br>

We talked till around 12:30 or 1 AM.<br>
Then I fell asleep.<br>

In the morning, I woke up to something horrifying.<br>

16–17 missed calls.<br>
From her.<br>

I called her immediately.<br>

Her voice was shaking.<br>

She told me that while I was sleeping,<br>
she saw my blanket moving downward on the video call.<br>

At first, she thought she was imagining it.<br>

But then she saw it clearly.<br>

Something was pulling it.<br>

She kept calling my name.<br>

I didn’t wake up.<br>

She asked me who was in the room with me.<br>

I told her—<br>
no one.<br>

I was sleeping on the top floor.<br>
The gates were locked.<br>
No one could enter.<br>

The moment I heard this, my body started trembling.<br>

Within hours, I had chills.<br>
My temperature rose to 102°F.<br>

I was extremely sick.<br>

When I told everything to my mother, she didn’t ask questions.<br>
She made me wear a Rudraksh.<br>

Slowly…<br>
the fever reduced.<br>
The fear settled.<br>

Today, I’m fine.<br>

But sometimes, when my phone camera struggles to focus—<br>
or when my blanket feels heavier than it should—<br>

I remember that night.<br>

And I wonder—<br>



What if it saw something…<br>
that I wasn’t supposed to see?<br>
