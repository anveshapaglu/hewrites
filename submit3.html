<p class="tagline">
A Place Where Nothing Bad Was Supposed to Happen
</p>

<p>
The society I grew up in believed it was protected from evil.
Lights stayed on till midnight—not because they had to, but because no one felt the need to turn them off.
Children played without counting time. Families laughed loudly, fearlessly.
</p>

<p>
Every evening, prayers floated through the air—God’s name repeated so often that it felt like a shield.
</p>

<p>
Fear didn’t belong there.  
At least, that’s what we believed.
</p>

<p>
But some places don’t ask permission to exist.
</p>

<p>
Her house stood slightly apart from the rest, like it had chosen isolation on its own.
Always locked. Always dark. No lights, even on festivals.
</p>

<p>
People didn’t stop walking near it—they stopped talking about it.
</p>

<p>
They only ever said one thing:
<br><br>
<em>“She’s not normal.”</em>
</p>

<p>
No one explained what normal meant.  
And no one dared to ask.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Curiosity Has a Sound</h2>

<p>
That evening began like every other. Swings creaked under careless weight.
Children shouted names that echoed through the tunnel.
Laughter bounced off concrete walls—loud enough to feel permanent.
</p>

<p>
Until it wasn’t.
</p>

<p>
Silence didn’t arrive suddenly.
It crept in. Slowly. Patiently.
Like it had been waiting.
</p>

<p>
Then I heard my name.
Not aloud.
It felt like a breath inside my skull.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Beauty Makes You Trust What You Shouldn’t</h2>

<p>
She didn’t look dangerous. That was the first mistake.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes didn’t blink.
They didn’t look curious.
They watched me like I was already late.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Darkness Isn’t Always the Absence of Light</h2>

<p>
Inside, there were no lights.
Not broken. Not switched off.
Just… none.
</p>

<p>
The floor was wet.
Warm.
</p>

<p>
I didn’t ask what it was.
Some questions feel dangerous even before they’re spoken.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Knocking Wasn’t Human</h2>

<p>
The third knock didn’t sound like knocking.
It sounded desperate.
</p>

<p>
The needle was already inside my skin.
Blood slid into glass.
Each bottle labeled.
Children’s names.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Some Things Don’t End</h2>

<p>
They said I was safe.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes, in complete darkness—
when silence feels too heavy—
</p>

<p>
I still remember her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Waiting.
